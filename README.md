# tesla-dashboard-python
Interactive Tesla Deliveries &amp; Production Dashboard built using Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit.

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive **Tesla Deliveries & Production Dashboard** built using **Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly**. It reimplements a Tableau dashboard through vibe-coding principles, demonstrating the full translation of an analytical workflow into a reproducible, code-driven pipeline.

The dashboard enables users to explore:

- Yearly and monthly **deliveries, production, and revenue trends**
- **Model-level** and **region-level** performance breakdowns
- Key performance metrics including **YoY Growth**, **Delivery Efficiency**, and **Monthly Revenue (Millions)**
- Dynamic filters for **year**, **month**, **model**, and **region** to tailor the analysis

Built with Streamlit, the application provides an intuitive interface, interactive charts, KPI cards, and a clean analytical design that supports deeper insights into Tesla's operational performance from **2015–2025**.

This repository includes:

- The complete Streamlit application (`tesla_dashboard.py`)
- Logic for data loading, wrangling, KPI calculations, and visualization
- An example of how Tableau dashboards can be re-created and enhanced through a fully programmable analytics workflow
